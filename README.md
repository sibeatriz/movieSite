# Abstract

Film Studies is a website where everyone online can review any movie or television show that they have seen. Users can interact with one another through discussions, subscribe to each other’s accounts, and receive notifications for new reviews. Based on a user’s review score on a show, a suggestion of recommended shows will appear on the user’s homepage.

The website helps its users by making reviews easily accessible, including both specific reviews written by users they trust and a variety of other reviews via the suggestion system that could inspire the users to discover other shows.

# Competitors

What sets Film Studies apart from its competitors is that it possesses all the desired components that others noticeably lack. One of its competitors has recently removed their forum and has stopped the discussion between users on select shows; another website only handpicks reviews from critics to place onto their website. Film Studies provides a space for users to interact freely with one another and have all their reviews given equal weight.

# Audience

Film Studies’ target audience is anyone between the ages of 15 and 55 of either gender who watches any sort of digital media form on which an individual can form an opinion. The individual is either passionate about what they have just watched and would appreciate a space online where they could share their perspective, or is just wanting a website where they could quickly rate shows and receive suggestions towards their next couch surfing escapade.
 

# Project Scope

Features implemented will begin with a dynamic front page pending on the latest movies released. Incorporated alongside it would be a ratings system amongst shows included with the user’s review, movie suggestions based on previously liked and highly reviewed shows, and user pages showing their review history and comments. Users will also have access to a search bar that can browse through certain genres, tags, or simple keyword strings. Of the users there will be three groups, including basic user, verified user, and admin.
